Organizations often have limited forms of feedback, like 360 reviews, or appreciations in retros. However, these have limitations: they can be private, anonymous, or relatively infrequent. We (the creators of this app, Jen &amp; Josh) think it's important to have an easy way to share appreciation with others publicly and frequently. We hope people find this app beneficial.
